**Problem statement**: The discovery of the Higgs boson by CMS and ATLAS Collaborations was announced at CERN in 2012. In this work, we focus on the potential of Machine Learning and Deep Learning in detecting potential Higgs signal from one of the background processes that mimics it.

**Dataset**: The dataset is made available by the Center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems at University of California, Irvine. The dataset can be found on the UCI Machine learning Repository

**Description**: The dataset consists of a total of 11 million labeled samples of Higgs vs background events produced by Monte Carlo simulations. Each sample consists of 28 features. The first 21 features are kinematic properties measured at the level of the detectors. The last seven are functions of the first 21.
